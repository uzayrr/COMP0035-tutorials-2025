# Introduction

_*Theme: Using Python to work with data*_

Note: This topic relates to Coursework 2 and is not needed for Coursework 1.

This week introduces concepts related to classes and how they can be used when working with data from databases. You
should work through all the activities, as the concepts build on each other and are designed to be learned
progressively.

Each type of class discussed in Activities 1, 3, 4, and 8 has different syntax, which can seem confusing at first.
However, in COMP0034 and COMP0035, you will primarily use SQLModel with an SQLite database, so focus on that syntax.

By the end of this week, you should understand:

- What a class is, including its attributes and methods
- What it means when one class inherits from another
- That ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a pattern for mapping Python classes to database tables

You should also be able to:

- Define a class using SQLModel that maps to a database table
- Create an SQLite database from classes defined using SQLModel
